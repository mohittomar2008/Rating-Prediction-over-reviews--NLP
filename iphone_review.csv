Just wow!,"In this price.....this phone is fantastic guys

Battery is massive 😍
Screen is excellent ...,.... Camera is average but not bad in this price u don't get everything perfect. ( Look pictures which is taken from the same phone )

Great product,Thank you for Flipkart again for good condition mobile infinite hot 12 play . Ram 4. B.t.600 m...64 .?,5
Classy product,"This is a very premium looking mobile with large display without any notch.... Despite of HD+ display it looks very vibrant... Very good for multimedia consumption... Has a huge battery provides you long duration battery backup... Processor is quite capable for gaming, not recommend for hardcore gamers.... Having only 10W charger takes longer time to get charge than expected.... Weakest point associated with the device is it's camera output both front and rear... Not get heated too much while...

Simply awesome,"Awesome mobile, this is my 4th mobile from infinix. Infinix S5 lite, Smart, infinix hot 10 play and infinix hot 12 play. I love this mobile among all other infinix mobiles which I have bought so far.",5
Terrific purchase,"I am really addicted to Infinix brand, because it is doing truly amazing by bringing super smartphone at super price. No other company is doing such thing. So we have now really became a true Infinix family. Started from Infinix hot 8(which is working super fine till now) to recent Infinix hot 12 play.

Don't think much, don't waste time by searching on the internet, just buy it bilndly and you will definitely thanks me later.",5
Must buy!,"After 15 days of use reviewing this, phone is very good in performance, display colour ,battery, handy usable. Avarage uses time on internet is 8hours in a day cause of my work is mobile phone internet based , even I am getting upto 1.5-2 days battery backup. Just mind blowing and value for money. But I recommend to user plz use a silicon back cover for more effective, because the plastic cover which is given by company is not durable and it will break after maximum 3-4days.",5
Good,This phone is good in this price range but only one think is very much needed in this is fast charging support and in the box fast charger adaptor which can charge the device in less time. This phone has charging 0-100 within 4-5 hours.which was too much high time,3
Slightly disappointed,"Cons:- Camera is little bit bad and sound quality is whack and display covers up almost all the screen which makes playing games harder because you skin touches the side screen and you will give multiple touch response even when you don't intend too

Pros:- Very good battery life with awesome looks and value for money with. Good mobile performance.

Writing this review at start of the arrival might change my review after few weeks of use

Update:- the phone heat up very fast when you play eve...

Highly recommended,"Just awesome camera is good
Battery omg just perfect
Display is very good one
Totally worth for money
It's similar to tecno mobiles
Best part is its made in india
And it also provides you a plastic transperant cover but that's not enough to protect ur phone...it would be just enough to protect ur phones from scratch but it breaks easily...it breaks in just 1week...mean it gets some scratches and breakouts",5
Slightly disappointed,"Everything is fine except battery charging , but this UI is new for me so , making some difficult for me..
I got this phone on 25th of June , after draining battery fully , when I plugged in to charge .

Pros:
- Powerful battery backup
- Bigger screen display
- Performance..nicely tuned processor and ram
- Reasonable camera quality based on the price range

Cons:
- Long battery charging time
- Display screen that's height wise bigger than compared to width. Height could have been a tad lesser by making it a little wider.
- Speaker-sound cracks ...

Decent product,"Value for money. I am using a Samsung phone for the first time. Switched from Redmi Note 8 pro to this phone because my old phone has radiation issues and I could feel the pain while using it.

Awesome,I'm a big fan of SAMSUNG. Most of the electronics products in our home are from Samsung. It's a brand of quality and durability.It is far better than that of the Chinese brands.

Digital well-being feature is awesome but my old phone automatically shutdown on the set time. This one feature is missing in this phone. Instead it makes the screen black and white. After all there is an option to turn this off.
When the phone is off there is no quick option to operate mobile and hence makes the mind to goto sleep.",4
